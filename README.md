# Admin-Shoe 🥾👟

> A modern admin dashboard built with React, TypeScript and Vite — designed for managing shoe-shop data, products, inventory, users (and more as you extend it).

## ✅ Why Admin-Shoe?

`admin-shoe` gives you a strong starting point for building a full-featured admin UI with a modern web stack:

- ⚛️ React + TypeScript — safe, maintainable, and developer-friendly.  
- ⚡ Vite — fast development and build times with HMR. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- 🧹 Clean configuration and minimal setup — no heavy boilerplate.  
- 🛠️ ESLint + Type-aware linting — ensures code quality and reduces runtime bugs.

This project is ideal if you want an admin dashboard scaffold to build on (e.g. for e-commerce, inventory management, CMS), or if you want to learn best practices in project structure, linting and build tooling.

## 📦 Features (So Far / Planned)

- Core React + TS + Vite setup  
- Structured folder layout — scalable and maintainable  
- Type-checked linting for safer code (via ESLint + TS)  
- Ready-to-extend for admin dashboard features (products, users, orders, etc.)  
- Build & dev scripts included — easy to get started  

> ⚠️ **Note**: This is a template / scaffold — you’ll need to implement domain-specific logic (API integrations, state management, UI components) based on your use case.
